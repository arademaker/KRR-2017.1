;this program cannot be queried twice without restarting its state,
;because the :on-clauses properties of the symbols will not be reset,
;which will cause them to decrement the :remaining property of the
;clauses more than they should, which causes the program to return
;false results.
;
;input: a finite list of atomic sentences, q 1 , . . . , q n
;output: YES or NO according to whether a given KB entails all of the q i
;1. if all of the goals q i are marked as solved, then return YES
;2. check if there is a clause [ p, ¬p 1 , . . . , ¬p n ] in KB, such that all of its
;negative atoms p 1 , ..., p n are marked as solved, and such that the
;positive atom p is not marked as solved
;3. if there is such a clause, mark p as solved and go to step 1
;4. otherwise, return NO
